# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
    This project was to create a program that would transpose morse code messages, that would be recieved by the hardware, and flash the LED lights either green or red depending on the dot or dash matirx of the letter.  It was working through being able to send messages to a device that isn't capable displaying full text.


# What did you do particularly well?
    with this program, I was able to program the interrupts and timers to work properly with the device.  So you could essentially go in and change the time for each and add things to be able to change the message received by the other end. 


# Where could you improve?
    I think that everything is a leanring experience, and the program itself might be fairly simple. SO there are probably a few things that could be manipulated that aren't supposed to be, so I could imporve on the coding of it to ensure that things that need to stay firm stay firm and it can't be manipulated to spread things I woudlnt' want spread. 


# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    I like to utilize the tutor services and the Shapiro library through SNHU, but also online forums are good place to get second sets of eyes on something whenn you are working ith it.  Also through work we have a mentor program that I have used to try and get some help from people in this type of business already.


# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    The problem solving skills from this project will be transferable to other prjects and also the work with timers on this will be useful for future projects as well. 


# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
     I did this by following good coding practices, and guidelines.  Also the comments in the code, will hep tohers understand what is going on.  It is adaptable because it is able to be changed to work with the program or the devcie you are working wiht but also able to have the message changed if needed.
